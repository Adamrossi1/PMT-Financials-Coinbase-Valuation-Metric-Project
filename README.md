# PMT-Financials-Coinbase-Valuation-Metric-Project
Hey all, this code is a simple calculator to compute a valuation metric based off 5 financial screener ratios: P/E Ratio, P/S Ratio, P/B Ratio, Enterprise value/EBITDA, Gross profit/EBITDA. Using a requests module, I pulled financial data from Coinbase and 4 of its competitors. I then stored this data in a PANDAS dataframe. Subsequently, I used a statistics module to compute the precise percentile for all 5 screeners from each company relative to Coinbase and its competitors. Lastly, I computed the mean of these percentiles for each company.
